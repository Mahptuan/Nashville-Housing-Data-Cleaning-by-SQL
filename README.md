# Nashville-Housing-Data-Cleaning-by-SQL

The Nashville Housing Data Cleaning project focused on enhancing the quality and usability of a dataset using SQL. The key objectives were to standardize the date format, populate missing property address data, break down the address into individual columns (Address, City, State), remove any duplicate entries, and delete unnecessary columns. By implementing these data cleaning steps, the project aimed to ensure consistency, accuracy, and improved analysis capabilities for the Nashville housing dataset.
